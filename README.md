# TO DO
## Hairs screensaver

- Better colors
    - 3-point gradient
    - Choose color based on perlin noise sampler
    - start at black, then to color, then end at slightly brighter color.
- length clamped better, not from 0 to 1 but like from 10 to 30 or something
- It's probably fluid, not perlin.
